## Salmon Cookies

This website was built for the client Pat to showcase his Salmon Cookies Coffee Stand as well as store and display his sales data.  Functionality was expanded to allow the Client to add future franchise locations through the use of a form on the sales page.

### Reflections and Comments

This project was very challenging and required significant time and effort to implement. I am most excited by the JS functionality and that I now have a reasonably good understanding of how it works. Going back and significantly refactoring my code after everything was complete and fully functional was a good exercise and allowed me to better understand how each piece of code works together.
